## :hammer: THINGS TO DO AFTER FRESH INSTALLATION

---

-   set nemo as the default file browser

```
xdg-mime default nemo.desktop inode/directory application/x-gnome-saved-search
```

-   set your terminal as the default terminal for Nemo. To do that, you can use the following command: gsettings set org.cinnamon.desktop.default-applications.terminal exec terminal-name. I use Alacrity as my terminal, so

```
gsettings set org.cinnamon.desktop.default-applications.terminal exec alacritty
```

-   Install the Nemo file rollerâ€”the file archiver extension for Nemo. Installing this helps extract and compress files.

```
pacman -S nemo-fileroller
```

## :sparkles: Customisation

---

-   To change the theme of Nemo, first install the theme and set it using this command: gsettings set org.gnome.desktop.interface gtk-theme new-theme. I use the catppuccin-mocha theme; it has a nice dark interface.

```
yay -S catppuccin-gtk-theme-mocha
```

```
gsettings set org.gnome.desktop.interface gtk-theme Catppuccin-Mocha-Standard-Blue-dark
```

-   Install lxappearance and change theme using that to change gtk theme for widgets as well.
-   You can disable the menubar from the top file options -> View -> Menubar (you have to press Alt to show it after disabling it).
-   You can disable or enable the side bar by pressing F9.
-   You can customize your toolbar from preferences options, Edit -> Preferences -> Toolbar
